## Installation and Setup Instructions

Installation is a hassle so I wouldn't bother for now...Will probably fix

## Reflection

This is a project I've been working on during my free time, mostly in order to learn new technologies and get better at those I already know. The reason for a project planning app was that it seemed to utilize a lot of different technologies, and also seemed to be a more complex project than anything I had done before. 
During the project I have encountered some challenges. One of those challenges was mongoDB in its entirety, since it was my first time using it. But after fiddling with it for some time it felt rather smooth.
Another challenge was storing profile pictures, using Google Cloud Storage. This was my first time using GCS aswell and I'm glad Youtube tutorials exist. I made it work by storing references to the images in mongoDB.

The technologies used in this project are React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Node.js, MongoDB and Google Cloud Storage.

During the project I have learned a bunch.
